704.0069,dynamical objects for cohomologically expanding maps,"the goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. we prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. this allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. a dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. it means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the derham cohomology groups. our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting.",1,0,0,0,0

704.0582,continuous interfaces with disorder: even strong pinning is too weak in   2 dimensions,we consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. there is a detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions without disorder. then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the gibbs measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.   how does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the hamiltonian modify this transition? we show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause delocalization. the proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. in 2 dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to localization. we also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the pinning force tends to infinity.,1,0,0,0,0

704.0954,sensor networks with random links: topology design for distributed   consensus,"in a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate, or communication. the signal-to-noise ratio (snr) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link. these probabilities are then a proxy for the snr under which the links operate. the paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. to consider this problem, we address a number of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2) establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail; and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph describing the network topology to be strictly positive. with these results, we formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. we show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.",1,0,0,0,0

704.0967,cross-layer optimization of mimo-based mesh networks with gaussian   vector broadcast channels,"mimo technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity for mesh networks. in a mimo-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a gaussian vector broadcast channel. recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper coding'' (dpc) is the optimal transmission strategy for gaussian vector broadcast channels. so far, there has been little study on how this fundamental result will impact the cross-layer design for mimo-based mesh networks. to fill this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing dpc power allocation in the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a mimo-based mesh networks. it turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging non-convex problem. to address this difficulty, we transform the original problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. for the transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient method. in our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network performance gain of 34.4% by using dpc.",1,0,0,0,0
